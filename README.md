# Clustering_Time_Series_Prediction_NTU_apartments
Key Words: Exploratory Data analysis, Time Series Prediction, memory enhanced metacognitive neural networks. Guide : Prof Sundaram Suresh (NTU- Singapore) I worked on the electricity consumption data of NTU buildings. The first phase of the project involved obtaining the data, collating and cleaning it and performing cluster based exploratory exploratory data analysis. The goal was to find insights about the patterns of electricity consumption at NTU for user profiling and power management. The second phase focused on developing a memory enhanced, metacognitive neural network based algorithm for time series prediction. Tools: Jupyter, Python data science and machine learning modules, R

This work was part of my summer internship.

Work is in progress to publish this as a journal article. Hence I am not at a liberty to share the codes and results.
I will keep update the repo with these as soon as possible.
Stay Updated!!
